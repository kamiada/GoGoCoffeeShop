# GoGoCoffeeShop
As the repo title says - Go Go Coffee Shop app ;) done in Go. 

How it will work: 
there will be three actors: Customer, Cashier, Barista.
1. Customer will see the coffee menu. 
2. Each coffee has it's own price and time of making which is visible for Barista and Cashier only. 
3. Cashier will accept the order, give customer the token and pass the order to Barista. 
4. Barista will take time per each ordered coffee. 
5. After preparation is finished, Barista will pass the coffee to Cashier. 
6. Cashier will pass the coffee to correct Customer. 
5. Customer can randomly like or dislike coffee. 

I found this blog post quite helpful as an inspiration for this mini project - https://massivetechinterview.blogspot.com/2015/07/thought-works-oo-design-for-coffee-shop.html

And this blog posts and videos been good read and watch for better understanding of Go:
